# CPPND: Capstone - Covid-19 Social Distance Monitoring

This is a repo for Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

As Covid-19 cases rapidly growing, it is important for people to keey safe distance during public gathering. This project is a real-time automated social distance monitoring system built with Yolov3 and OpenCV.

The project satisfies the following rubric points:
1. The submission must compile and run.
2. The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
3. The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.
4. The project accepts user input and processes the input.
5. The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
6. Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
7. Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
8. Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
9. Classes encapsulate behavior.
10. Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.
11. Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.
12. Templates generalize functions in the project.
13. The project makes use of references in function declarations.
14. The project uses destructors appropriately.
16. The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible.
17. The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
18. The project uses multithreading.
19. A promise and future is used in the project.
20. A mutex or lock is used in the project.
21. A condition variable is used in the project.
